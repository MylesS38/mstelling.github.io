            <h2>Hi there!</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my corner of the internet :). I created this page to share what I'm working on and any other curiosities I might find interesting!</p>
            <p>If you want to learn about me, my bio page details out my work/academic experience as well as some things about myself. If youre interested in what I've worked on/am working on, check out my projects. And, most importantly, if you'd like to read some (hopefully entertaining) blabs, read my blog!</p>
            <p>Well, that's all I've got! If you like color and imaging science as much as I do, I hope you can glean some interesting tidbits from what I'm doing or, at the very least, a chuckle at whatever I end up blogging about. Peace!</p>
