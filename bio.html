            <h2>Who is this guy anyway?</h2>
            <p>I'm Myles, If you haven't picked up on that yet (I know this website is so subtle). I'm currently studying to earn my masters in Color Science at RIT and I have a deep interest in all things imaging and color.
            I earned my bachelors at RIT in Motion Picture Science and I spent some time working at Picture Shop as a support engineer in their dailies department. Most of my background in color and imaging science centers around
            its applicaiton in film and television, but I'm interested in its other applications in areas such as remote sensing, medical imaging, and AR/VR. I'm hoping to gain lots of exposure while I'm back up in Rochester to other industries
            in need of color science so that I can explore different avenues where I can apply my knowledge and help make advancements in the world of imaging.</p>
            <h2>Why color science?</h2>
            <p>So then, all of this talk about color and imaging begs the question - what's the big deal? Well, personally, I didn't know color science was so interesting until I learned more about it in undergrad. </p>
            <h2>They really let you make a website?</h2>
            <p>Indeed! Much to the dismay of the general public, it is easier than ever to create a website and yap to my hearts content. A frightening prospect, if there ever were one...</p>
